# Guerrilla
This game is based of Assassin's Creed, but it has it own features and game play. Its based during a WWII area, you play as a Polish citizen who signs up at the beginning of the war to fight for his country but he has special abilities... Assassin. So during the course of the war you bounce around Europe fighting the Nazi regime, you fight in places like Amsterdam, Berlin, Paris, even El Alamein. This isn't as great as Assassin's Creed but its something close to it. This version that will be publish to GitHub, Itchi.IO will be a demo not the full realease, if you want the full release go to my website to buy the full game when it comes out. Conzelend Studios if you want to buy the game.
